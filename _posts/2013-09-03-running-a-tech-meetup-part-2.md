In my [last post](http://jtbarbour.com/posts/running-a-tech-meetup-part-1/ "Running a Tech Meetup Part 1"), I discussed the kick-off event, meetup format, and speakers. In this one I will address many of behind the scene decisions to keep a meetup running such as sponsors, venues, and advertising.

### Sponsors
Meetup sponsorship is one of the most difficult parts of running a meetup. In the end a sponsor must feel that they are receiving value from their funds. This could be recruitment or just having the association with your group. For DSMD, we've found that the best way to recruit sponsors is to highlight their involvement during the networking portion and introduction of the event while also listing them on the meetup page. It is not expensive for a company recruiter to send mass amounts of LinkedIn messages, so highlighting a sponsors willingness to use their funds to sponsor events in the community may motivate members to consider sponsors when looking for new opportunities. 

It is important to not let sponsorship influence the quality of the meetup. Having speakers from a sponsoring company can work as long as the presentation doesn't become only a sales pitch. We've had great success in working with local companies to have sponsored events with quality technical presentations that explain how company products work. Finding a sponsors that truly wants to engage the community and build a long lasting relationship are the best companies to work with.

*Find sponsors that can become partners.*

### Venues

Venues should be viewed the same as a sponsor. What surprised me the most with venues is that when I first thought we needed to pay for a venue, I was wrong, but when I found a company I assumed would want to host us, they ended up charging us. There are numerous generous companies out there willing to host quality meetups as long as they are treated as a contributing sponsor.

The layout of the meetup will greatly influence the networking and discussion that takes place. Given the ability to take their food and sit down in a chair, many members will do just that and not try to meet other members. One of the most successful arrangements we had was having the food and drink in the lobby with a sign that disallowing anything in the lecture hall. This forced members to stand, move around, socialize, and kept people excited and awake. In part three I will discuss how food selections can also impact a meetup.

For DSMD we have held two breakfast events and found that having one organizer at the front and one in the rear helps to get members engaged and asking questions. This way the the conversation becomes as a stream of statements passing over the audience's head, just beckoning them to jump and talk.

*Like sponsors, find venues that can become partners.*

### Advertising

There is a fine line between advertising and being annoying, but embrace Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. When emailing potential speakers, advertise your next event and invite them to attend. Suggest that they share the information with their friends and colleagues. Attend as many meetups as you can to network. One secret I do is whenever I receive a LinkedIn request from a recruiter, I politely reply that I am not interested and then advertise our meetup. As Malcolm Gladwell described in *The Tipping Point*, finding the Connectors and Mavens can help make an idea and a meetup successful. 

Personally, I think business cards for meetups makes the group seem professional and something worth attending. Early on I felt it was very important that we had a high quality logo we could display on our meetup page and cards. Our logo design was recognizable and often receives compliaments from new acquaintances. 

*Advertise whenever possible.*

In the last part of the series I will discuss food, networking, and media.
