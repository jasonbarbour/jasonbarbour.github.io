Back in December 2012, when I first considered starting <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-MD">Data Science MD</a>, one of main reasons was for me to learn more about the field of data science. There were several awesome meetups in the DC area that featured quality speakers where the audience could learn about an interesing topic. I figured that if we could bring those types of events to Maryland then I could accelerate my learning of data science. However, after eight months and multiple meetups, what I have really learnt is how to organize and host a successful technology focused meetup. During my time running DSMD, I have made a few observations and felt it would be usefull to capture some of the lessons learnt. 

### Kick-off
One of the biggest mistakes I see with new technology meetups is expecting your membership to initially build the meetup. Many groups will try to start with a kick-off event whose sole agenda is to define how the meetup will be run. **Don't do this.** While this may seem like a noble idea, it is usually a recipe for failure. Rarely do members go to kick-off events, and if they do, they probably won't return. A member must feel they are getting value from the meetup, and sitting around helping the organizer plan future events isn't exactly the best use of time. Successful meetups must have a driving team of organizers that from the start create events that people will want to attend. The first event determines the life of a meetup. A structured quality event shows that the meetup will be well run and members know there is value in attending.

*Have a well defined first meetup.*

### Format

Structure does not mean that having outside speakers is the only format that works. An open forum is perfectly acceptable, but there should at least be a set agenda of topics with the organizers moderating the discussion. Putting a dozen or so members in a room with nothing in particular to talk about will result in a lot of bored faces drifting to look at their iPhones. Having a speaker lineup makes a meetup more approachable to the general member who just wants to come and learn.

*Provide value to all members.*

### Speakers
Creating a pipeline of speakers is easily the most time consuming part of running a meetup. Often scheduling a particular speaker takes months of communication. When DSMD first started I naively thought that once we had a good number of members that speakers would be asking me to speak. In reality nearly all speakers required some solicitation and perservance. In order to bring in quality speakers it is important to fully tap your professional network. Use LinkedIn, reach out to local universities and companies, follow other meetups, and read local news stories to find interesting individuals that may be able to speak on a topic. Next send an email that highlights your group and how the topic they are knowledgable in would make a great presentation.

*Work hard to find speakers.*

In the follow-up part I will discuss sponsors, venues, and advertising.
