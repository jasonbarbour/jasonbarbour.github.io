I am a software engineer fascinated with the world of data analytics and data science. In December 2012, I co-founded the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-MD">Data Science MD</a> meetup, and I can proudly say we are one of the largest and fastest growing technology meetups in Maryland. This Fall I will be teaching a <a href="http://magazine.loyola.edu/issue/academics/5514/the-big-deal-about-big-data">Big Data</a> course at Loyola University.
